As an example a physics law about rigid objects can be considered: an abstraction of a token can easily hide the fact no two rigid objects can be at the same place in time. Furthermore, each moving physical object has a finite speed. On the other hand, when a transition fires a token from one place to another is transfered immediately. All these problems are addressed in an extension of the Simulator called Visual Simulator.  We use an asynchronous communication between the Visual Simulator and the 3D engine to reflect the speed difference problem mentioned above. 3D engine comes with a support for collision detection which helps to detect rigid object problem.
